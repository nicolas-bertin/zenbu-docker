# ZENBU docker
ZENBU is a data integration, data analysis, and visualization system enhanced for next-generation-sequence-tag (NGS) based data.

ZENBU allows for novel data exploration through **"on-demand" data processing** and **interactive linked-visualizations** and is able to make many-views from the same primary sequence alignment data which users can uploaded from BAM, BED, GFF and tab-text files. 

Data integration, data processing, and visualization system based around three main web interfaces: 
  - an expression data enhanced genome browser interface
  - a secured user system for data upload and secured data sharing
  - a data explorer interface to find and manipulate data across the many supported experimental data types and to find shared user configurations"
